## Core Java Concepts

Explore foundational Java programming concepts:

- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
- **Language Features** - Annotations, lambda expressions, method references
- **Design Principles** - POJO structure, proper encapsulation with getters/setters
- **Memory Management** - Understanding the Java Memory Model
- **Interfaces & Abstractions** - When and how to use each effectively

## Reflection API

Learn about Java's powerful introspection capabilities:

- **Runtime Type Information** - Examining classes during execution
- **Dynamic Invocation** - Calling methods and accessing fields programmatically
- **Practical Applications** - Real-world use cases with code examples

## Spring Boot Framework

Dive into modern Java application development:

- **Spring Core** - IoC container, dependency injection, bean lifecycle
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming** - Cross-cutting concerns, pointcuts, advice types
- **Proxies** - Understanding Spring's proxy mechanisms
- **Configuration** - Annotations vs. XML, best practices

## Java Streams

Master Java's functional-style operations:

- **Stream Processing** - Filtering, mapping, reducing collections
- **Collectors** - Transforming streams back into practical data structures
- **Optional** - Properly handling nullable values
- **Parallel Processing** - Leveraging multi-core architectures for performance

## Multithreading

Control concurrent execution in Java applications:

- **Thread Fundamentals** - Creation, lifecycle, and management
- **Thread Pools** - Efficient resource utilization with ExecutorService
- **Concurrency Patterns** - Practical solutions to common threading problems
